1. We weren't able to get the response after submitting the test of POST, we fixed it by sending the full content of request 
2. time is a big problem that our c++ compiler weren't able to get the right UTC time, it somehow just pospond the time for a coulple hours
3. Given time display issues, we later fixed our expiration time based on counting relaitve time
4. We didn't consider max-stale so we fixed it to conform with expiration rules 
5. We used boost so there were problem when we build Docker, we later included -lboost_regex -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem to our Makefile to fix it.
